This here is a password manager made in C# to manage all of your private information you sign in to websites with. I made this because I do not believe it's a good idea to store your passwords on your browsers. This is an alternative to that. While there are many other mainstream password managers, this one is open source so you can know where your passwords and other data are going if you're fluent in the language it was written in.
